# Welcome!!

On behalf of Galaxy Project, we welcome you to **Galaxy Mentor Network**.

Whoop whoop!

Galaxy Mentor Network (GMN) is a community of mentors and mentees. The GMN is launching a two-month mentoring program designed for Galaxy community members to come together as mentors and mentees to achieve a goal, share knowledge and expertise, ask questions, receive feedback, network, and most of all, get support from peers(mentors) without having to wait for days for a response from the community via the Help Forum or communication channels.

This mentorship program will help members transition smoothly from one part of the community to another. It will also help members learn how to use the Galaxy tools and servers efficiently. The end goal of this project is to develop more experienced members and to speed up the growth process for new members who join the community.

The project goes to show how people-centered the Galaxy community is. Every member will have the opportunity to be mentored by topic-based experts and mentors. Professors and students carrying out their projects can work on their projects under the guidance of mentors.

This GMN project is a win-win for all participants: Mentors grow in experience, gain new leadership skills and sharpen their expertise, while members can learn about open source, how to create, materials, or even carry out their projects with expert supervision and guidance.

Join us for our exciting online launch event where we will be telling you everything you need to know about the **Galaxy Mentor Network** program and answer any questions you may have as regards the program.
