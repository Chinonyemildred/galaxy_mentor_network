## The Galaxy Mentoring Network Program

Galaxy Mentoring Network (GMN) program is an initiative by the Galaxy Community to build her members in open source projects.

It is run on an open enrollment basis where mentees and mentors can apply at any time of need, this is so especially because we have a lot of new members who join regularly and may immediately need someone to guide them. This is a program by Galaxy members and for Galaxy members.

Do you need guidance on a project? Need help learning how to contribute to open source? Guidance in settling into the Galaxy ecosystem? More?
