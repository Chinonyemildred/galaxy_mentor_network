## Galaxy <a name="Galaxy"></a>
### What is the Galaxy?
[Galaxy](#) is an open-source, open science platform for data integration and analysis that is deployed in hundreds of organizations around the world. 

Galaxy was originally developed to support genomic data integration and analysis, and that is still the most common domain it is used in.  However, the platform itself is domain agnostic and can be used in any research domain that uses shared data formats and is compute and data-intensive.  Galaxy is now used in related domains such as proteomics, computational chemistry and molecular modeling, as well as in domains such as climate modelling and natural language processing that are far from life science.

### Why did Galaxy create the Galaxy Mentor Network (GMN)?
Galaxy is a global community of researchers, trainers, students, bioinformaticians, software developers, and infrastructure providers, all using the Galaxy platform (https://galaxyproject.org/) to perform and support data-intensive research. There are hundreds (possibly thousands) of Galaxy deployments around the world, and tens of thousands of researchers and students use Galaxy every year. Hundreds of community members contribute to the project every year, through support, training, presentations, events, code, tools, testing, and documentation.

Galaxy is a sprawling ecosystem and a dispersed community. It is easy for newcomers to get overwhelmed by the many Galaxy resources and community communication channels. The Galaxy Mentor Network is established to connect newcomers with experienced community members to help prevent newcomers from getting lost.

## The Galaxy Mentor Network program <a name="GMN"></a>

### What should I know about the GMN programme?
Designed for any Galaxy members (both new and existing), this two months Gmentoring programme will equip participants (Gmentees and Gmentors) with a broad set of practical skills to boost knowledge and thrive in the Galaxy community.

**Gmentees** can be any Galaxy member. During the course of the program, Gmentees are required to complete their individual or team projects and share them with their Gmentor. 

Gmentees must be willing to accept constructive feedback from their Gmentors related to their projects and goals and commit themselves to continuous growth and improvement in project skills and knowledge in order to develop new skills and expertise and to be proficient and grow with Galaxy.

**Gmentors** are seasoned Galaxy community members who can commit to regular meetings for 2 months (recommended: at least 30 mins meetings biweekly). Gmentors help to ensure their Gmentee has a successful transition into the Galaxy community. 

They serve as a resource and repository of information, connect with people and the community, assist in purposeful networking, and provide thought and guidance throughout the completion of the project.

**Network Managers** are the programme coordinators. They help with pairing Gmentors with Gmentees, sending mail to both Gmentors and Gmentees to inform them about their acceptance into the program, monitoring the progress of the Gmentorship, collecting feedback, and ensuring Gmentor and Gmentee complete the program. They are also the mediator when either Gmentor or Gmentee has any challenges during the process.

This Galaxy Gmentor Network Programme helps participants (network managers, Gmentors, Gmentees) to:
- share their expertise and develop skills and knowledge vital to create, lead, and contribute to Galaxy projects.
- connect with members across different projects, communities, backgrounds, and identities.
- empower each other to become effective Galaxy community members.

### How to join the program?
**As part of the process:**

Gmentees join this program with goals that they want to achieve during this program. With support from their mentors, they complete these successfully.

Gmentors join the program by indicating their availability and willingness to mentor someone.

Network Managers accept to be part of the program by replying to the invite message.

### Can you tell me more about the Gmentors-Gmentees-Pairing (MMP) Process?
Once a Gmentee submitted an application, it will be reviewed by the network manager and then shared with the pool of possible Gmentors. The Gmentors select their own Gmentees together with the network manager. The areas of Gmentorship are not limited to: Contributing to the community, Running data analysis, Instructing students, and Carrying out projects. This opportunity will help them over a period of two months to develop new skills and expertise and to be proficient and grow with the ecosystem.

There are 2 general rules: 
- Discussions and everything you will share with your Gmentor will remain between you (except in case of Code of Conduct violation)
- Gmentor & Gmentee schedule a minimum of a monthly virtual meeting.

Each Gmentor/Gmentee is provided with a toolkit (slide deck, short video, and note-taking document) at the beginning of the programme. The programme is at hand to help throughout the process.

### What happens at the end of the two months of Gmentoring? Can I continue my Gmentorship relationship?
Of course! Beyond the two months, Gmentor/Gmentee relationships continue based on the mutual interest of both parties. Officially, the program winds down after two months, but some of the best Gmentoring relationships continue well past the end of any formal, organizationally sanctioned timeframe.

### What happens if I need to leave the programme before it is concluded?
It is not recommended to leave the programme before it is concluded, as it is a unique opportunity and experience that will add value to you from the beginning to the end. Its flexible nature allows you to accommodate other responsibilities while participating in the programme. If, however, you have to leave the programme, please notify us immediately so that someone else can be matched with your mentoring partner.

### How will I know if I'm doing a good job?
Open communication is the key to any good Gmentoring.
